As Omega-6 fatty acids are critical for various bodily functions, such as brain function, skin health, and inflammation regulation, their demand is expected to rise globally. The market is particularly expanding in regions like North America and Europe, where there is a growing inclination towards functional foods, dietary supplements, and plant-based alternatives. Furthermore, the rising prevalence of chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, has increased the consumer demand for Omega-6-rich food products that support heart health and overall well-being.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>The demand for Omega-6 fatty acids is further supported by the increasing use of Omega-6-rich oils such as soybean, sunflower, and corn oils in food production. The ongoing trend of incorporating plant-based oils into the food and beverage industry, along with the rise in vegetarian and vegan diets, is playing a crucial role in the market's growth. Additionally, the growing popularity of clean-label products and organic food alternatives has spurred the development of new Omega-6 enriched products, enhancing their availability in the market.</p> <p>Another factor contributing to the market’s expansion is the rising interest in the nutraceutical and dietary supplement sectors. Omega-6 fatty acids are marketed as a key ingredient in supplements for their anti-inflammatory properties, skin health benefits, and potential to promote weight management.
